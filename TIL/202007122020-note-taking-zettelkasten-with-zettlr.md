# Note Taking "Zettelkasten" with Zettlr

[Zettlr](www.zettlr.com) seemed to be an interesting app for working with Markdown. I was confronted with "Zettelkasten" as a way of organizing notes in the getting started guide of this app. I liked the idea of throwing every note against a system and have a way to find it again, without caring too much about where to create the note in a hierarchy. Note: I'm already using [Notion](www.notion.so) for creating a knowledge base and collecting notes. 

## How it works (very short version)
The system relies on giving your notes an id and tags. You can link notes by it's id very quick and search for tags in the app. Having a frontpage for a group of notes, you can also use the ids to create an overview of the notes on it.

## Pros/Cons
This system works really well in [Zettlr](www.zettlr.com) as you can easily find your notes by searching for multiple tags. The problem for me is that the whole system relies on using [Zettlr](www.zettlr.com) but you won't be able to use the quick linking feature with the ids on GitHub where I would store all the notes to be able to access them on an other machine or on mobile.

## Next step: improving my Notion workflow
Next I started to improve my note taking system on [Notion](www.notion.so) by using lists or tables where I can add tags as well. The problem here is that the search function will only allow to search for one tag at a time and the filter function is way to complicated for a quick search. So just throwing a random note in here and put 2 tags to it won't work if the tags itself are too generic.

## Conclusion
After discovering this way of taking notes I will continue searching for a system that works inside the app but where I'm also able to access and search the notes from everywhere.
